      ```

3. After programming, connect the USB Type-C connector (J9) on the kit to a USBPD source device via the USB Type-C to Type-C cable. The User LED (LED3) on the board will blink at different rates depending on the type of power adapter connected:

   - If a power adapter supporting USB Power Delivery is connected, the LED blinks at about 5 Hz (toggles every 100 ms).
   - If a USB Type-C power adapter or a Standard Downstream Port (SDP) is connected, the LED blinks at about 1 Hz (toggles every 500 ms).
   - If a Downstream Charging Port (DCP) is connected, the LED blinks at about 0.17 Hz (toggles every 3 seconds).
   - If a Charging Downstream Port (CDP) is connected, the LED blinks at about 0.05 Hz (toggles every 10 seconds).

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and Implementation

The PMG1 devices support a USBPD block which integrates the Type-C terminations, comparators, and the Power Delivery Transceiver required to detect the attachment of a partner device and negotiate power contracts with it.

On reset, the USBPD block is initialized with the following settings:

   - The receiver clock input of the block is connected to a 12 MHz PERI-derived clock.
   - The transmitter clock input of the block is connected to a 600 kHz PERI-derived clock.
   - The SAR ADC clock input of the block is connected to a 1 MHz PERI-derived clock.
   - The SAR ADC in the USBPD block is configured to measure the VBUS_TYPE-C voltage through an internal divider.

The PDStack middleware library implements state machines defined in the **Universal Serial Bus Type-C Cable and Connector Specification** and the **Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification**. This application uses the PDStack in an UFP (Upstream Facing Port) - Sink configuration. PMG1 devices have a dead-battery Rd termination which ensures that a USB-C source/charger connected to it can detect the presence of a sink even when the PMG1 device is not powered.

**Figure 1. Firmware Flowchart**

<img src = "images/pdsinkflow.png" width = "300"/>

The PDStack configures the USBPD block on the PMG1 device to detect Type-C connection state changes and USBPD messages, and notify the stack through callback functions. The callback function registers pending tasks which are then handled by the PDStack through the `Cy_PdStack_Dpm_Task` function, which is expected to be called at appropriate times from the main processing loop of the application.

**Figure 2. PDStack Task Flowchart**

<img src = "images/pdstacktask.png" width = "600"/>

The PDStack library uses a set of callbacks registered by the application to perform board-specific tasks such as turning the consumer power path ON/OFF and identifying the optimal source power profile to be used for charging. In this examples, these functions are implemented using the appropriate APIs provided as part of the Peripheral Driver Library (PDL).

The stack also provides notification of various connection and PD policy state changes, so that the rest of the system can be configured as required. These events are used by the example application to implement a separate USB Battery Charging 1.2 Sink state machine, which distinguishes between a Standard Downstream Port (SDP), Charging Downstream Port (CDP), and Downstream Charging Port (DCP). The BC 1.2 Sink state machine is activated only when the power source connected does not support USB Power Delivery. The GPIO connected to LED3 on the board is toggled at different rates to indicate the type of power source which is detected by the PDStack and the BC 1.2 Sink state machine.

The application tries to keep the PMG1 device in **deep sleep** where all clocks are disabled and only limited hardware blocks are enabled, for most of its working time. Interrupts in the USBPD block are configured to detect any changes that happen while the device is in sleep and wake it up for further processing.

An Over-Voltage (OV) comparator in the USBPD block is used to detect cases where the power source is supplying incorrect voltage levels and automatically shut down the power switches to protect the rest of the components on the board.

### Compile-time Configurations

The PMG1 USBPD Sink application functionality can be customized through a set of compile-time parameters which can be turned ON/OFF through the *config.h* header file.

| Macro Name          | Description                           | Allowed values |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------ | :------------- |
| `CY_PD_SINK_ONLY`     | Specifies that the application supports only the USBPD Sink (Consumer) role | Should be set to 1u |
| `NO_OF_TYPEC_PORTS`   | Specifies the number of USB-C ports supported | Should be set to 1u |
| `CY_PD_REV3_ENABLE`   | Enable USBPD Revision 3.0 support | 1u or 0u |
| `PD_PDO_SEL_ALGO`     | Specifies the algorithm to be used while selecting the best Source Capability to power the board | 0u, 1u, 2u or 3u |
| `VBUS_FET_CTRL`       | Selects the gate driver to be used to turn the consumer power path ON (applicable only in case of CY7110) | 0u or 1u |
| `BATTERY_CHARGING_ENABLE` | Enables BC 1.2 (CDP/DCP) detection when connected to a non-USBPD power source | 1u or 0u |
| `SNK_STANDBY_FET_SHUTDOWN_ENABLE` | Specifies whether the consumer power path should be disabled while PD contracts are being negotiated | 1u or 0u |
| `SYS_DEEPSLEEP_ENABLE` | Enables device entry into deep sleep mode for power saving when the CPU is idle | 1u or 0u |
| `APP_FW_LED_ENABLE` | Enables toggling of User LED (LED3) based on type of power source | 1u or 0u |

### PDStack Library Configuration

The USB Type-C connection manager, USB Power Delivery (USBPD) protocol layer, and USBPD Device Policy Engine state machine implementations are provided in the form of pre-compiled libraries as part of the PDStack middleWare library.

Multiple variants of the PDStack library with different feature sets are provided; you can choose the appropriate version based on the features required by the target application.

   - PMG1_PD3_SNK_LITE: Library with support for USB Type-C sink operation and USBPD Revision 3.0 messaging.
   - PMG1_PD2_SNK_LITE: Library with support for USB Type-C sink operation and USBPD Revision 2.0 messaging. Using this library will reduce the flash (code) memory usage by the application.

The library of choice can be selected by editing the **Makefile** in the application folder and changing the value of the `COMPONENTS` variable. To use the PD revision 2.0 library, replace the `PMG1_PD3_SNK_LITE` reference with `PMG1_PD2_SNK_LITE`.

The properties of the USB-C port including port role and the default response to various USBPD messages can be configured using the EZ-PD Configurator utility. Click on the **EZ-PD Configurator 1.0** item under **Tools** in the Quick Panel to launch the configurator.

**Figure 3. USB-C Port Configuration using EZ-PD Configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_port_info.png" width = "800"/>

Properties of the USB-C port are configured using the **Port Information** section. Because this application supports only USBPD Sink operation, the **Port Role** must be set as **Sink** and **DRP Toggle** must be disabled. Other parameters such as **Manufacturer Vendor ID** and **Manufacturer Product ID** can be set to desired values.

The **Source PDO** and **SCEDB Configuration** sections are not applicable for this application because only Sink operation is supported.

**Figure 4. Sink Capability configuration using EZ-PD Configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_sink_pdo.png" width = "800"/>

The power capabilities supported by the application in the Sink role are specified using the **Sink PDO** section. See the Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification for details on how to encode the various sink capabilities. A maximum of seven PDOs can be added using the configurator.

**Figure 5. Extended Sink Capability configuration using EZ-PD Configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_ext_snk_cap.png" width = "800"/>

The **SKEDB** section is used to input the Extended Sink Capabilities response that will be sent by the application when queried by the power source. See the Power Delivery Specification for details on the Extended Sink Capabilities format.

Once the parameters have been updated as desired, save the configuration and build the application.

For quick verification of the application configurability, the **PD Operation** parameter under **Port Information** can be disabled. When the PMG1 device is programmed with this modification, you can see that the User LED blinks at a slower rate even when connected to a power source which supports USB Power Delivery.
